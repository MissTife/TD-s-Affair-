        <h2>Our Story According to Dami</h2>
        <p>It‚Äôs a year now Gosh! Time truly moves fast when you‚Äôre involved, diligent, and faithful to a course. </p2>
       <p>Wasn‚Äôt it just last year October that I noticed a fine ass woman on my TL; radiating Glory and beauty, exuding class and brilliance.</p2> 
       <p> I remember how swayed and captivated I was by her pictures, dress sense and outlook. 
I remember thinking to myself, if I liked her enough to send a DM or if it would just die down after a couple of days.
I remember myself going through your TL & media to carry out my research. The more I scrolled and search, the deeper the fondness for her hit me. 
I remember saying a half hearted silent prayer/confession that i like the beauty I saw and that I needed a push, and the sign came by she randomly responding to my tweets. 
I remember goggling and smiling at God, going back to check out her pictures and scooping you out one last time before sending the DM. 
And form that moment, it‚Äôs been a paradise of a ride with her. </p>

 <p>From our first phone call.
To our first meet up.
To our first hug.
To our first prayer.
To our first pleasure.

Every single thing reminds me of how assured I am being her man. </p>


<p>One Year has come and gone, we have forever to go. 
The Lord that has kept us this far will continue to keep, guide, order, supply and enable us to walk in His Will and purpose for us. 

Boluwatife Ogunfuyi, I consider it a privilege from God to be a man after His heart, and granting me the Honour of being your man. 

I love you wholeheartedly.
I love you completely.
I love you selflessly.
I love you because God first loved me. 
I love you entirely.

I want you to be mine for keeps for as long as God Will and grants strength.
I want you to be mine for purpose.
I want you to be mine for pleasure. 
I want you to be mine for comfort.
I want you to be mine to provide for. 
I want you to be mine to protect,
I want you to be mine to help you attain your goals.
I want you to be mine for penetration.
I want you to be mine for procreation. 

I love you to the ends of the age, baby B. ‚ô•ü´∂üèΩ.</p>
